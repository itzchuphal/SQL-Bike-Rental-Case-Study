###Bike Rental SQL Project

Emily is the shop owner, and she would like to gather data to help her grow the 
business. She has hired you as an SQL specialist to get the answers to her 
business questions such as How many bikes does the shop own by category? 
What was the rental revenue for each month? etc. The answers are hidden in the 
database. You just need to figure out how to get them out using SQL.


##Objectives

- Analyze the data of the Emily's Bike Rental Store
- Find out the different categories of bikes store is having
- What are the different types of membership plans?
- What is the total revenue of the store for each month, each year?
